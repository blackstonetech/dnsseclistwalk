DNSSECListWalk
==============

**DNSSECListWalk** takes a list of domains and determines their DNSSEC status.

History
=======

The original script was written by Scott Rose of NIST.
Richard Bullington-McGuire <rbullington-mcguire@bstonetech.com>, 
also known as @obscurerichard, adapted it for release at the 2011 1.USA.gov
Hack Day on July 29, 2011.

Environment
===========

This script requires Perl 5 and two Perl modules from CPAN [1]: 

* Email::Simple
* Email::Sender
* Net::DNS

You may install those into your system Perl installation using CPAN [1], or do use
local::lib [2] and cpanminus [3] to install those into a non-root user
directory, as current Perl best practices [4] suggest. If you have cpanminus
installed you need only issue this command:

    cpanm Mail::Sendmail Net::DNS

See one of the many tutorial introductions to installing Perl modules as
a non-root user [5] [6] for more information on setting this up.
